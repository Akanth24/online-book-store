# online-book-store
Online Book Store Project is a web-based application in Java, developed mainly for bookstores and shops to computerize the book purchasing process. 
This project aims at creating an efficient and reliable online book selling and buying platform. 
After the implementation of project, one can inquire and buy any book available in the store from anywhere.
To make this project we used the java swing

In order to implement this project, I used swing. Java swing was introduced in 1997. It is built on the foundation of the AWT. It has two key features:

Light weight component: swing components are written entirely in java and do not map directly to platform specific peers.

A pluggable look and feel â€“ each swing component are rendered by java code rather by native peers the look and feel of component is under control of swing.

I. Swing provides more powerful and flexible GUI component than does the AWT.

II. AWT is heavyweight whereas swing is lightweight.

III. The look and feel of each component if AWT were fixed, it cannot be changed.

IV. The use of heavy weight causes no flexibility So I preferred swing. I used the following swing component in the project I developed.

1.JFrame: It is an extended version of java.awtframe that adds support for the swing component architecture.

2.JPanel: The JPanel is a simplest container class. It provides space in which an application can attach any other component. It inherits the JComponents class.

3.JTabbedPane: The JTabbedPane class is used to switch between a group of components by clicking on a tab with a given title or icon. It inherits JComponent class.

4.JButton: It is an implementation of push button.

5.JLabel: It is a display area for a short text string or an image or both.

6.JTextfeild: It is a light weight component which allows the editing of a single line or text.
